                    Hello! My name is Edgar Ochoa Sotelo, and I’m currently a Computer Science student at New Mexico State University. Additionally, I work as an IT Tech II at Azurite Professional Community in Las Cruces, New Mexico. I’ve always been intrigued by technology, but it wasn’t until recently that I had the opportunity to pursue it. I decided to attend NMSU to obtain my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, and it’s been quite the journey so far. During my studies, I was fortunate enough to participate in the Google Tech Exchange program. In the Software Development Studio course, my classmates and were introduced to various technologies, such as Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Cloud Platform, and Git. We also had a course on Data Structures and Algorithms, which further developed my knowledge in these areas. By the end of the program, I had gained an in-depth understanding of full-stack development and data structures and algorithms. I continue to make progress in my education with the goal of graduating with a Computer Science degree by May 2025.
